    title: "Welcome to the Shahid Lab @ University of Sheffield"
    excerpt: "We study interspecies RNA communication and epigenetic regulation in parasitic plants and beyond. Our goal is to further the fundamental understanding of how mobile small RNAs influence host-parasite/symbiont interactions, and develop RNA-based solutions for improved parasite resistance in crops. See our [research](/research/) and [publications](/publications/) to learn more about what we do, and meet our current [lab members](/team/)!


    We are located in the Alfred Denny building at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/). We are members of the [Plants, Photosynthesis and Soil Cluster](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/biosciences/research/areas/plants-photosynthesis-and-soil) and the [Sheffield Institute for Nucleic Acids](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/sinfonia/home?pli=1). Feel free to reach out if you are interested in [joining the lab](/join/) or collaborating on research projects."
