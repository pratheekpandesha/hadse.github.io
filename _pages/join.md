## Life in Stillwater

Stillwater is a historic city with small-town charm and affordable living costs. It is located between Oklahoma's two largest cities - Oklahoma City and Tulsa. Known as the home of red dirt music, Stillwater has a vibrant art and culture scene with galleries, museums, live music, performing art events, concerts, and dozens of festivals that happen all-year round. Stillwater gets lots of sunshine and there are plenty of parks and recreational opportunities (Boomer lake park, Lake McMurty, Lake blackwell).
