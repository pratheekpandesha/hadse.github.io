![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/TE.png){: .align-right}{:width="300"} Often considered as the genomic ‘junkyard’, the non-genic regions of the genome are actually rich sources of many regulatory elements. These include **transposable elements** which are ubiquitous DNA fragments that can move within and across genomes, thereby causing structural variations / mutations. **Small RNAs** (20-24 nt) are another important class of non-genic elements that regulate gene expression through target RNA slicing (RNA interference) and defend the genome against harmful transposon activity. Growing evidence suggests that small RNAs can also move between closely interacting species and play important role in interspecies communication. Despite the regulatory potential of small RNAs and transposons, these are often poorly annotated in the genome which greatly hinders understanding the extent of their biological roles. Our Lab's central biological questions focus on the evolution, diversity, and regulation of non-genic elements and their role in interspecies communication (in particular **host - parasitic plant communication**). We use bioinformatics, genomics, and molecular biology approaches to address research questions.

Below are some of the current research projects in the Lab.

## How do mobile small RNAs facilitate host - parasitic plant communication?
